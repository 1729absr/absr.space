* Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!, Richard Feynman
    - "But we must consider Feynman in all his manifestations - a brilliant scientist, but also a narcissist whose sexist behavior did undeniable harm."
    ~ Caltech Letters: [Feynman, Harassment, and the Culture of Science: October 08, 2019](https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/feynman-harassment-science#1). If you are reading this book, you should also read the article.
* Nonlinear dynamics and Chaos, Steven Strogatz
* Lectures and Problems: A Gift to Young Mathematicians, V. I. Arnold
