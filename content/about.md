I developed a passion for physics in high school when I learned about the relationship between electricity and magnetic fields. My love for mathematics also began early on, especially when working with infinite series. More recently, I discovered my interest in computer programming while pursuing a Master's degree in computational physics and quantum mechanics.

My Masters thesis in physics focused on (auto-)correlation analysis of the wave function of interacting particles in a quartic double well, which helped me improve my numerical simulation and time-series analysis skills. I also worked as a project assistant at the Quantum and Nonlinear Dynamics Lab, where we recently studied the dynamics of a time-periodically driven quantum impact oscillator and found evidence of strange non-chaotic behavior in the wave function.
