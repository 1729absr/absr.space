Detecting exoplanets can be a challenging task because planets do not emit their own have nuclear energy sources. As a result, astronomers often rely on heavier and brighter stars to detect the presence of planets. Using telescopic data, astronomers analyze changes in the brightness of a star when a planet passes in front of it (known as a transit) or in frequency due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's wobble around a common center of mass, or Barycenter, indicating the presence of one or more planets. This method has been instrumental in discovering thousands of exoplanets beyond our solar system, providing a glimpse into the diversity of planetary systems in the universe.

For the purpose of this article, we are going to find the orbital parameters of a particular planet - HD 86081 from radial velocity data of the corresponding star - HD 86081. The data is attained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](). We have the data of the radial velocity of this
star that has been calculated from the data of the Dopplerâ€™s shift. Of course, this radial velocity is not the original velocity of the star but a component along the axis of our telescope. This should also theoretically follow a periodic pattern. In figure 1, we have a scattered plot of our raw data of radial velocity of the star and at first glance, there does appear any pattern in the data. A noticeable aspect of the data is that there are some promi- nent intervals of time when no data is collected.
